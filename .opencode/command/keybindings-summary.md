Generate a comprehensive keybindings summary from the dotfiles configurations.

Extract and document keybindings from:
1. dot_config/nvim/ - Neovim keybindings
2. dot_config/niri/ - Niri window manager keybindings
3. dot_config/shell/ - Shell aliases and functions
4. dot_local/bin/scripts/ - Custom script shortcuts

Create a quick reference guide organized by application/context.
Focus on the most useful and frequently used keybindings.
Format as markdown with clear categories and descriptions.
