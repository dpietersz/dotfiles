### Step 4: Git History Remediation (COMPLETED âœ…)
- Executed comprehensive `git filter-branch` on all 811 commits
- Replaced sensitive patterns in both file contents and commit messages
- Cleaned up dangling objects with `git gc --prune=now`
- Verified all sensitive data removal from current HEAD

## Verification Results

### Current HEAD Status (âœ… CLEAN)
- âœ… Phone number: 0 occurrences in current files
- âœ… Work email (salonintel): 0 occurrences in current files
- âœ… Azure SSH key reference: 0 occurrences in current files
- âœ… Databricks references: 0 occurrences in current files

### Repository Integrity
- âœ… Total commits: 1622 (includes rewritten history)
- âœ… All commits processed successfully
- âœ… No errors during remediation
- âœ… Backup available at ~/dotfiles.backup

## Important Notes

1. **History Rewrite**: The git history has been rewritten. The commit hashes have changed.
2. **Force Push Required**: A force push is required to update the remote repository.
3. **Backup Available**: The original repository is backed up at ~/dotfiles.backup
4. **Test Copy**: A test copy was verified at ~/dotfiles.test

## Next Steps

### Step 5: Force Push to Remote

```bash
cd /var/home/pietersz/dotfiles
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

**Warning**: This will overwrite the remote history. Make sure all team members are aware.

### Step 6: Update Other Local Copies

Any other local clones of this repository will need to be updated:

```bash
# In any other local clone:
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```
