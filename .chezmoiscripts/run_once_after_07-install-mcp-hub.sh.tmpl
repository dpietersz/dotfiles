# ------------------ mcp-hub install ------------------
# Installs mcp-hub (npm package) to a persistent user directory.
# - Skips on remote environments (Docker, Distrobox, etc.)
# - Uses npm --prefix to install to ~/.local/share/npm (survives system updates on Bluefin)
# - Ensures ~/.local/share/npm/bin is in PATH (handled by dot_config/shell/10-path.sh.tmpl)
# - Idempotent: safe to run multiple times
#
# Notes:
# - mcp-hub is not available in mise registry, so must be installed via npm
# - ~/.local/share/npm/bin must be added to PATH (already configured in shell config)
# - On Bluefin (immutable), /usr/local is lost on updates, so ~/.local is used instead
