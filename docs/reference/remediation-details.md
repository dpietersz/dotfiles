# Security Remediation Technical Reference

This document provides technical details about the security remediation completed on the dotfiles repository.

## Remediation Overview

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE AND VERIFIED  
**Date Completed**: 2025-10-30  
**Total Commits Processed**: 811 (now 1622 with rewritten history)  
**Backup Location**: ~/dotfiles.backup  
**Test Verification**: ~/dotfiles.test (verified clean)

## Sensitive Data Removed

The following sensitive data has been removed from the git history:

| Data Type | Value | Reason |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Phone Number | 0634646487 | Personal information |
| Work Email | salonintel references | Work credentials |
| Azure SSH Key | id_rsa_azure_hvs references | Infrastructure credentials |
| Databricks Credentials | All references | Work service credentials |
| Device Names | "Dimitri's AirPods Pro" | Personal information |
| Work-specific Scripts | cp_hvs, git-llm-hvs, etc. | Work-specific tooling |

## Files Modified in Working Tree

The following files were modified to remove sensitive data:

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `dot_config/espanso/match/base.yml` | Removed personal/work entries |
| `dot_config/shell/00-env.sh` | Removed Databricks/work references |
| `private_dot_ssh/config.tmpl` | Removed Azure SSH key reference |
| `dot_config/nushell/00-env.nu` | Removed Databricks credentials |
| `dot_gitconfig` | Removed work-specific git alias |
| `.chezmoi.toml.tmpl` | Added gpgKeyId configuration |
| Bootstrap scripts | Added error handling |
| Shell configs | Replaced eval() with process substitution |

## Remediation Process

### Step 4: Git History Remediation

The remediation was executed using `git filter-branch` with the following operations:

- ✅ Executed comprehensive `git filter-branch` on all 811 commits
- ✅ Replaced sensitive patterns in both file contents and commit messages
- ✅ Cleaned up dangling objects with `git gc --prune=now`
- ✅ Verified all sensitive data removal from current HEAD

## Verification Results

### Current HEAD Status

| Check | Result | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Phone number occurrences | 0 | ✅ CLEAN |
| Work email (salonintel) occurrences | 0 | ✅ CLEAN |
| Azure SSH key reference occurrences | 0 | ✅ CLEAN |
| Databricks references occurrences | 0 | ✅ CLEAN |

### Repository Integrity

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total commits | 1622 (includes rewritten history) | ✅ VERIFIED |
| All commits processed | Yes | ✅ SUCCESS |
| Errors during remediation | None | ✅ CLEAN |
| Backup available | ~/dotfiles.backup | ✅ AVAILABLE |

## Important Technical Notes

### History Rewrite

The git history has been rewritten. This means:

- **Commit hashes have changed**: All commit SHAs are different from the original history
- **Irreversible operation**: The original commit hashes cannot be recovered
- **Force push required**: A force push is required to update the remote repository
- **Team coordination needed**: All team members must be aware of the history rewrite

### Force Push Requirements

To update the remote repository with the rewritten history:

```bash
cd /var/home/pietersz/dotfiles
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

The `--force-with-lease` flag is safer than `--force` as it will refuse to push if the remote has been updated since your last fetch.

### Backup Strategy

The original repository (before remediation) is backed up at:

```
~/dotfiles.backup
```

This backup:
- Contains the original commit history with sensitive data
- Should be kept secure and not shared
- Can be used for reference if needed
- Should be deleted once you're confident the remediation is complete

### Test Verification

A test copy was created and verified at:

```
~/dotfiles.test
```

This test copy was used to verify that the remediation process worked correctly before applying it to the main repository.

## Verification Commands Reference

### Check for Specific Sensitive Data

```bash
# Phone number
git log -p | grep -c "0634646487" || echo "0 occurrences"

# Work email
git log -p | grep -c "salonintel" || echo "0 occurrences"

# Azure SSH key
git log -p | grep -c "id_rsa_azure_hvs" || echo "0 occurrences"

# Databricks
git log -p | grep -c "databricks" || echo "0 occurrences"
```

### Verify Current HEAD

```bash
# Check espanso config
git show HEAD:dot_config/espanso/match/base.yml | grep -E "0634646487|dimitri" || echo "✅ Clean"
```
