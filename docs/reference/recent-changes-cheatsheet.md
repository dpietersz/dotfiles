### Recently Added Keybindings

#### File Explorer (mini.files)

| Keybinding | Action | Mode | Category |
|------------|--------|------|----------|
| `<C-b>` | Toggle mini file explorer | Normal | File Navigation |
| `<leader>ef` | Open file explorer at current file location | Normal | File Navigation |

**Context**: The `mini.files` plugin provides a lightweight, keyboard-driven file explorer. These keybindings were added to provide quick access to file navigation without leaving the editor.

**Usage Tips**:
- `<C-b>` toggles the explorer on/off from anywhere
- `<leader>ef` opens the explorer and reveals the current file's directory
- Inside the explorer, use `H`/`L` to navigate, `h`/`l` for quick navigation, `q` to close

**Related Keybindings** (inside mini.files):
- `L` - Go into directory
- `l` - Go into directory (quick)
- `H` - Go out of directory
- `h` - Go out of directory (quick)
- `@` - Reveal current working directory
- `g?` - Show help

#### Snacks Picker - File Filtering

| Keybinding | Action | Mode | Context |
|------------|--------|------|---------|
| `<A-h>` | Toggle hidden files on/off | Normal | When file picker is open (triggered by `<leader>ff`) |
| `<A-i>` | Toggle ignored files (from .gitignore) on/off | Normal | When file picker is open (triggered by `<leader>ff`) |

**Context**: The Snacks picker provides powerful file filtering options while browsing. These keybindings allow you to quickly toggle the visibility of hidden files and gitignored files without closing the picker.

**Usage Tips**:
- Press `<leader>ff` to open the file picker
- While the picker is open, use `<A-h>` to show/hide hidden files (dotfiles, etc.)
- Use `<A-i>` to show/hide files that are in your `.gitignore`
- These toggles persist during the current picker session
- Useful for finding configuration files (hidden) or build artifacts (ignored)

**Related Keybindings**:
- `<leader>ff` - Open file picker
- `<leader>fg` - Find with grep
- `<leader>fb` - Find buffers
