# Dotfiles Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for your dotfiles repository. This documentation is organized using the [DiÃ¡taxis framework](./explanation/diataxis-framework.md), which divides documentation into four types based on user needs.

## Documentation Structure

### ðŸŽ“ [Getting Started](./getting-started/)

**Learning-oriented tutorials** for beginners. Follow step-by-step instructions to complete meaningful tasks and acquire skills.

- [Bootstrap Your Dotfiles](./getting-started/bootstrap.md) - Set up on a new machine
- [Make Your First Modification](./getting-started/first-modification.md) - Learn the agent system

### ðŸ“‹ [How-To Guides](./how-to/)

**Goal-oriented guides** for solving specific problems. Assumes you know what you want and focuses on achieving the goal.

- [Add Encrypted Keys](./how-to/add-encrypted-keys.md) - Securely add private keys to your dotfiles
- [Write Git Commits](./how-to/git-commits.md) - Follow conventional commit standards

### ðŸ“š [Reference](./reference/)

**Information-oriented documentation** for looking up facts and specifications. Neutral, factual descriptions of the machinery.

- [Conventional Commits Format](./reference/conventional-commits-format.md) - Commit message specification

### ðŸ’¡ [Explanation](./explanation/)

**Understanding-oriented documentation** that provides context and background. Explores the "why" behind design decisions.

- [DiÃ¡taxis Framework](./explanation/diataxis-framework.md) - Why and how this documentation is organized
- [Daily-Driver Containers](./explanation/daily-driver-containers.md) - Understanding containerized development environments

## Quick Navigation

## Using the Agent System

For modifying configurations and installing applications, see the [OpenCode Agent System documentation](./../.opencode/README.md).

## Key Concepts

### DiÃ¡taxis Framework

This documentation follows the [DiÃ¡taxis framework](./explanation/diataxis-framework.md), which organizes documentation around user needs rather than product features. This means:

- **Tutorials** teach you skills through hands-on practice
- **How-to guides** help you solve specific problems
- **Reference** provides factual information to consult while working
- **Explanation** helps you understand the "why" behind things

### Conventional Commits

This repository uses [Conventional Commits](./how-to/git-commits.md) for all git commits. This enables automated changelog generation and semantic versioning.
