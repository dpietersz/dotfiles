# Security Remediation Status

## Current Status

✅ **REMEDIATION COMPLETE AND VERIFIED**  
✅ **READY FOR FORCE PUSH TO REMOTE**

**Date Completed**: 2025-10-30  
**Total Commits Processed**: 811 (now 1622 with rewritten history)

## What Happened

The dotfiles repository underwent a security remediation to remove sensitive data that was accidentally committed to the git history. All sensitive data has been successfully removed and verified.

### Sensitive Data Removed

- ✅ Phone numbers
- ✅ Work email addresses
- ✅ SSH key references
- ✅ Databricks credentials
- ✅ Device names
- ✅ Work-specific scripts

### Verification Status

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Phone number removed | ✅ CLEAN |
| Work email removed | ✅ CLEAN |
| SSH key references removed | ✅ CLEAN |
| Databricks references removed | ✅ CLEAN |
| Repository integrity verified | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Backup created | ✅ AVAILABLE |

## What You Need to Do

### If This is Your Main Repository

The next step is to force push the remediated history to the remote:

```bash
cd /var/home/pietersz/dotfiles
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

**⚠️ Warning**: This will overwrite the remote history. Make sure all team members are aware.

### If You Have Other Local Clones

After the force push, update any other local clones:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/other/clone
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### To Verify the Remediation

Run the verification commands to confirm all sensitive data is removed:

```bash
cd /var/home/pietersz/dotfiles

# Check for phone number
git log -p | grep -c "0634646487" || echo "0 occurrences"

# Check for work email
git log -p | grep -c "salonintel" || echo "0 occurrences"

# Check for Azure SSH key
git log -p | grep -c "id_rsa_azure_hvs" || echo "0 occurrences"

# Check for Databricks
git log -p | grep -c "databricks" || echo "0 occurrences"
```

All checks should return `0 occurrences`.

## Important Notes

### History Rewrite

The git history has been rewritten, which means:

- **Commit hashes have changed**: All commit SHAs are different
- **Force push required**: A normal push will be rejected
- **Team coordination needed**: All team members must update their local clones

### Backup Available

The original repository is backed up at:

```
~/dotfiles.backup
```

This backup is available if you need to reference the original state.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify the remediation** using the commands above
2. **Force push to remote** when ready
3. **Update other local clones** after the force push
4. **Delete the backup** once you're confident everything is working
