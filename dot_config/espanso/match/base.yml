# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.

# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espanso/espanso/dev/schemas/match.schema.json

matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":?"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  - trigger: "!s"
    replace: "Do a deep-dive on the code and understand how [insert feature] works. Once you understand it, let me know, and i will provide the task I have for you."

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  - trigger: "#btw"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "pass show Personal/btw"

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y%m%d"

  # Print the output of a shell command

      My tech stack features TypeScript 5 as the primary language, paired with SvelteKit 5 for building modern, scalable web applications. For data fetching and UI enhancements, I rely on libraries such as Convex, Shadcn UI, Superforms for validation, Svelte Email for email functionality, Svelte runes for state management, phosphor-icons-svelte for icon design elements, and AutoAnimate for animations. On the backend, I use Convex together with PostgreSql for database and authentication, Railway for deployment, Nginx for reverse proxying, while GitHub Actions handles CI/CD workflows and Biome ensures consistent code formatting and linting. Tailwind CSS v4 is also part of the stack to quickly style the application with a utility-first approach.

      1. Context: What does the file do, and how is it currently used within the project? If it interacts with other parts of the system, highlight that.
      2. Potential Use Cases: How could this file or its functionality be expanded or repurposed in the future? Any creative ways it might add more value?
      3. Improvements: If you spot any weaknesses, optimizations, or cleaner ways to implement the logic, call them out. Is there any refactoring or restructuring worth doing?
      4. Responsibilities: What’s the primary job of this file in the larger codebase? Does it serve a single purpose, or is it multitasking?

      Here is the code you need to comment:

      <code>
      {put your code files here}
      </code>

      To complete this task, follow these steps:

      1. Carefully analyze the code to understand its structure and functionality.
      2. Identify key components such as functions, classes, loops, conditionals, and any complex logic.
      3. Add comments that explain:

        - The purpose of functions, classes, or code blocks
        - How complex algorithms or logic work
        - Any assumptions or limitations in the code
        - The meaning of important variables or data structures
        - Any potential edge cases or error handling

      When adding comments, adhere to these guidelines:

      You are an experienced software engineer tasked with explaining a code file to a fellow engineer over the phone. Your goal is to provide a clear, casual, yet technically accurate breakdown of the file's purpose, functionality, and potential improvements.
      Here's the content of the code file you need to analyze:

      <code_file>
      {{CODE_FILE}}
      </code_file>

      Carefully examine the code above and prepare an explanation that covers the following aspects:

      1. Context: Describe what the file does and how it's currently used within the project. If it interacts with other parts of the system, make sure to highlight that.
      2. Potential Use Cases: Discuss how this file or its functionality could be expanded or repurposed in the future. Think creatively about ways it might add more value to the project.
      3. Improvements: Identify any weaknesses, potential optimizations, or cleaner ways to implement the logic. Suggest any refactoring or restructuring that might be worth considering.
      4. Responsibilities: Explain the primary job of this file in the larger codebase. Determine if it serves a single purpose or if it's handling multiple tasks.

      When crafting your explanation, follow these guidelines:
        - Keep the tone casual and conversational, as if you're chatting with a friend who's also a skilled engineer.
        - Use technical language appropriate for an experienced developer, but don't hesitate to include analogies or references if they help clarify complex concepts.
        - Be concise while ensuring all important points are covered.
        - Feel free to use humor or informal expressions where appropriate, but maintain a professional undertone.

      Structure your response using the following XML tags:

      <context>Explain the file's purpose and current usage</context>
      <use_cases>Discuss potential future applications or expansions</use_cases>
      <improvements>Suggest optimizations or refactoring opportunities</improvements>
      <responsibilities>Clarify the file's primary role in the codebase</responsibilities>

      You are tasked with documenting a folder of files and identifying necessary changes based on linting errors. Your goal is to create comprehensive documentation that explains what each type/function does, provides examples where helpful, explains the "why" behind design decisions, and makes it easier for new team members to understand the code. You should follow Google's jsdoc documentation style for consistency.
      First, you will be provided with the content of the code folder:

      <code_folder>
      {{CODE_FOLDER}}
      </code_folder>

      Next, you will be given the linting errors:

      <linting_errors>
      {{LINTING_ERRORS}}
      </linting_errors>

      Please follow these steps to complete the task:

      1. Analyze the code and linting errors:
        - Read through all the files in the code folder.
        - Review the linting errors and understand which parts of the code they refer to.
      2. Document each file:
        - For each file, create a documentation section.
        - Explain the purpose of the file and its role in the overall project.
        - Document each type, class, and function within the file.
        - Use clear and concise language to describe what each element does.
      3. Explain design decisions:
        - For important or complex parts of the code, explain the reasoning behind the design choices.
        - Discuss any patterns or architectural decisions that are crucial for understanding the codebase.
      4. Provide examples:
        - Where appropriate, include code examples to illustrate how to use specific functions or classes.
        - Ensure that the examples are clear, concise, and demonstrate typical use cases.
      5. Follow Google's jsdoc documentation style:
        - Use appropriate jsdoc tags for documenting parameters, return values, types, etc.
        - Maintain consistency in formatting and style throughout the documentation.
      6. Identify necessary changes:
        - Based on the linting errors, identify the changes that need to be made to improve the code.
        - Explain why each change is necessary and how it will improve the code quality or functionality.
      7. Format your output:
        - Present your documentation and suggested changes in a clear, organized manner.
        - Use appropriate headings and subheadings to structure the information.

      Please provide your complete documentation and analysis within <documentation> tags. Include a separate section for suggested changes based on linting errors within <suggested_changes> tags.
      Remember to focus on making the documentation helpful for new team members to understand the code quickly and easily. Your goal is to create clear, comprehensive, and consistent documentation that follows best practices and improves the overall quality of the codebase.
