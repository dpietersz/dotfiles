# Monthly Review

Guide me through a monthly review workflow. I want to:

1. Audit orphan notes (notes with no connections)
2. Refine MOC structure
3. Archive completed projects
4. Prune fleeting notes that went nowhere
5. Review and update aliases and tags
6. Check for duplicate or overlapping notes
7. Identify advanced techniques to introduce
8. Plan next month's focus areas

Please help me maintain system health and identify growth opportunities.
