# Find Orphan Notes

Please find orphan notes in my system (notes with no connections) and help me connect them. For each orphan:

1. Identify why it might be isolated
2. Search for related notes
3. Suggest meaningful connections
4. Explain the relationship for each link
5. Ask if these connections make sense

Help me integrate isolated knowledge back into my knowledge graph.
