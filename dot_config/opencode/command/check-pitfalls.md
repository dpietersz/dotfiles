# Check for Pitfalls

Please analyze my notes for common pitfalls:

1. **Scope Creep**: Notes with "and also..." (multiple ideas)
2. **Over-Fragmentation**: Notes too small to be useful
3. **Weak Connections**: Links without explanations
4. **Hoarding**: Capturing without processing
5. **Weak Titles**: Titles that don't capture the idea
6. **Orphan Notes**: Notes with no connections
7. **Inconsistent Naming**: Mix of naming conventions

For each issue found, explain why it's a problem and suggest how to fix it.
