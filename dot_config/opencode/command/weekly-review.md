# Weekly Review

Guide me through a weekly review workflow. I want to:

1. Review all notes created this week
2. Link recent notes to older ones
3. Update existing MOCs with new notes
4. Identify emerging clusters and themes
5. Connect any orphan notes
6. Refine MOC structure if needed

Please help me see patterns and connections I might have missed.
