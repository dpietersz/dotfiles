# Create Map of Content

I think I need a Map of Content for a topic. Please:

1. Analyze my existing notes
2. Identify clusters of related notes
3. Determine the best MOC type (Hub, Structure, or Index)
4. Propose a MOC structure with organization and groupings
5. Suggest which notes should be included
6. Explain the reasoning for the organization

Show me the proposed MOC structure before creating it, and help me understand how it will improve navigation and reveal patterns.
