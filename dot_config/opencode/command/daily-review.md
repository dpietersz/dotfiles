# Daily Review

Guide me through a daily review workflow. I want to:

1. Process my fleeting notes from yesterday
2. Convert 1-2 of them to permanent notes
3. Identify any obvious connections
4. Clean up my inbox

Please ask me clarifying questions about each fleeting note and help me decide which ones are worth keeping and converting to permanent notes.
