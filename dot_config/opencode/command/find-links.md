# Find Links

I've created a new note and want to find meaningful connections to existing notes. Please:

1. Analyze my note carefully
2. Search my existing notes for related ideas
3. Suggest 3-7 strategic links
4. Explain the relationship type for each link (expands, contradicts, applies, supports, etc.)
5. Rate connection strength (strong, moderate, weak)
6. Ask if these connections make sense

Show me the proposed links with reasoning before I add them to my note.
