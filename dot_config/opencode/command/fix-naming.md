# Fix Naming & IDs

Please audit my notes for naming consistency. Check:

1. **IDs**: Valid timestamp format (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS), no duplicates
2. **Titles**: Complete sentences, descriptive, specific, no jargon
3. **File Names**: Match titles (slugified), lowercase with hyphens
4. **Aliases**: Capture alternative names, help with searching
5. **Tags**: Consistent, lowercase with #, meaningful and specific

For each inconsistency found, propose the fix with reasoning before applying changes.
