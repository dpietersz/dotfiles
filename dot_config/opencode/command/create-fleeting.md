# Create Fleeting Note

I have a new idea I want to capture as a fleeting note. Please ask me clarifying questions to help me articulate it clearly before I write it down.

Use Socratic questioning to help me:
- Clarify what I actually mean
- Identify the core insight
- Understand why it matters
- See connections to existing ideas

Then help me write a clear fleeting note that captures the essence of the idea.
