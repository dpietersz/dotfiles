# Inbox Processor Guide

## Overview

The **Inbox Processor** is a specialized subagent that intelligently processes notes from your inbox folder one-by-one, assesses their maturity level, and routes them through the appropriate workflow.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Command
```
/process-inbox
```

### Option 2: Direct Invocation
```
@inbox-processor I want to process my inbox
```

## How It Works

### 1. Scan Phase
- Lists all notes in `$HOME/dev/Notes/inbox/`
- Sorts by filename
- Shows total count

### 2. Assessment Phase (for each note)
- Reads note content
- Determines maturity level (1-4)
- Explains assessment to you

### 3. Recommendation Phase
- Suggests appropriate workflow
- Shows reasoning
- Offers workflow options

### 4. Processing Phase
- Executes your chosen workflow
- Invokes appropriate subagents
- Asks clarifying questions
- Moves note to appropriate folder

### 5. Tracking Phase
- Updates MATURITY_TRACKER.md
- Shows what was accomplished
- Asks about next note

## Note Maturity Levels

### Level 1: Fleeting (< 50 words, very vague)
**Example**: "Atomic notes are better"

**Characteristics**:
- Single phrase or sentence
- No clear structure
- Vague concepts

**Workflow**: @note-clarifier
- Asks 5-7 clarifying questions
- Helps you articulate the idea
- Summarizes refined understanding

### Level 2: Partial (50-150 words, some clarity)
**Example**: "Atomic notes are better because they're reusable. You can link them together and build a knowledge graph."

**Characteristics**:
- Multiple sentences
- Some structure emerging
- Needs refinement

**Workflow**: Direct questions + @note-processor
- Asks clarifying questions
- Structures the note
- Formats as atomic note

### Level 3: Semi-Structured (150-300 words, mostly clear)
**Characteristics**:
- Clear main idea
- Some explanation
- Needs formatting and linking

**Workflow**: @note-processor + @link-strategist
- Structures properly
- Finds connections
- Adds links

### Level 4: Well-Formed (300+ words, clear structure)
**Characteristics**:
- Complete explanation
- Ready for permanent folder
- Needs linking and validation

**Workflow**: @link-strategist + @quality-checker
- Finds connections
- Validates quality
- Proposes improvements

## User Interaction

For each note, you'll see:

```
