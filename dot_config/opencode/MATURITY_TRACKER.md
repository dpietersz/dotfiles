# Second Brain System Maturity Tracker

This file tracks your progress through building your second brain system. The primary agent reads this at the start of each session to understand your current stage and adjust guidance accordingly.

## Current Stage

**Stage**: 0 (Starting from scratch)
**Date Started**: 2025-10-29
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-29

## Stage Definitions

### Stage 0: No System Yet (Day 1)
- [ ] Folder structure created (inbox/, literature/, permanent/, maps/, archive/)
- [ ] First fleeting note captured
- [ ] Understand atomic note principles
- [ ] Know naming conventions

**Next Step**: Create folder structure and capture first fleeting note

---

### Stage 1: Initial Captures (Week 1)
- [ ] 5-10 fleeting notes captured
- [ ] 1-2 permanent notes created
- [ ] Basic understanding of note structure
- [ ] Started daily review habit

**Next Step**: Create first permanent notes and start linking

---

### Stage 2: Building Connections (Week 2-3)
- [ ] 5-10 permanent notes created
- [ ] Basic linking started (2-3 links per note)
- [ ] Understand linking strategy
- [ ] Weekly review started

**Indicators**: You see connections between ideas and are linking them

**Next Step**: Accumulate more notes and identify clusters for MOCs

---

### Stage 3: Emerging Patterns (Month 1)
- [ ] 20-30 permanent notes created
- [ ] First Map of Content created
- [ ] Regular linking (3-5 links per note)
- [ ] Weekly reviews happening
- [ ] Understand MOC purpose

**Indicators**: You see clusters of related notes and need organization

**Next Step**: Create more MOCs and refine system structure

---

### Stage 4: Mature System (Month 2+)
- [ ] 50+ permanent notes created
- [ ] Multiple MOCs (3-5+)
- [ ] Regular review workflow (daily/weekly/monthly)
- [ ] System feels organized and navigable
- [ ] Consistent naming and tagging

**Indicators**: System is useful and you're discovering insights through linking

**Next Step**: Introduce advanced techniques

---

### Stage 5: Advanced System (Month 3+)
- [ ] 100+ permanent notes created
- [ ] Advanced techniques in use (progressive summarization, hub notes, etc.)
- [ ] Graph view analysis happening
- [ ] System is self-maintaining
- [ ] Regular insights from connections

**Indicators**: System is mature and generating emergent knowledge

**Next Step**: Maintain and evolve based on your needs
