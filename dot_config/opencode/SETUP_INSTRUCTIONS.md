## Key Principles

1. **Start Simple**: Don't wait for perfect system
2. **Process Regularly**: Daily reviews are key
3. **Link Intentionally**: Explain every connection
4. **One Idea Per Note**: Split if "and also..." appears
5. **Ask Questions**: Agents guide, don't dictate
6. **Propose First**: See changes before they're made
7. **Trust the Process**: Insights emerge over time

## Next Steps

1. **Today**: Run `chezmoi apply` and start with `/create-fleeting`
2. **This Week**: Build daily review habit
3. **Next Week**: Do your first weekly review
4. **Next Month**: Do your first monthly review

## Support

- **Questions**: Ask the primary agent: `@second-brain what should I do next?`
- **Documentation**: See QUICK_START.md or SECOND_BRAIN_README.md
- **Progress**: Check MATURITY_TRACKER.md to see your stage
- **Issues**: Use `/check-pitfalls` to scan for common mistakes

## Remember

This system is a tool to help you think better, not a system to maintain. Start simple, iterate, and let it evolve with your needs.

**Your second brain is ready. Let's build something great!** ðŸ§

**Questions?** Start with `@second-brain` and ask anything. The system is designed to guide you.
